# Armature: Fullstack Framework

To use:

```bash
bunx create-armature-app ./project-name
```

# JSX to HTML

# Signal based reactivity

# API layer

# Automatic API documentation

# Lightweight and fast


Note: I developed this framework as an exploratory project to deepen my understanding of rendering and runtimes. While it was not initially intended as a production-ready solution, it has proven to be effective and reliable for my personal projects, aligning with my preferred workflow.
I am open to collaboration and welcome suggestions for improvements, as I recognize that there is always room for growth and refinement. Although I am currently unable to maintain the project full-time, I am enthusiastic about the possibility of continued development with the support of sponsors. With two months of dedicated effort already invested, I am eager to see this framework evolve and reach its full potential.
